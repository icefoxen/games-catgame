First stage:
Wake up, stretch, wash, and head out to hunt.  Lives in a rather nice cave in
a mountainside on an island.  Pass by the Oracle on the way; she's just
wandering around chilling.
So there's the usual movement tutorial of fly/run/fight etc, and then a
freakin' dragon shows up and starts torching the place.  Boss battle!  It more
or less comes out as a tie with both of you getting knocked down.  This is how
your wings get injured.
